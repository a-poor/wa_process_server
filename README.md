# Wrongfully Accused â€“ NYC Housing Court

_created by Austin Poor_

This project was the equivalent of a senior-thesis that I worked on for the course Wrongfully Accused in 2018. I investigated litigation practices in NYC housing court. One of my main focuses was on the improper service of process for eviction notices.

In the course of my investigation, I spoke with numerous sources (lawyers, judges, process servers, and advocates), submitted a FOIL requests to the City of New York, visited NYC housing court, and used data science tools to web-scrape and analyze housing court records.

The final result of my project was a 4,000+ word article that you can read as [markdown](./ProcessServerArticle.md) or as a [pdf](./ProcessServerArticle.pdf).

I've included in this repo some of the resources I used in my reporting. You can find the code I used for webscraping [here](./code/) as well as a subset of the data I scraped, in CSV format, [here](./data/scraped/aggregateDataSet_01_reformatted.csv).

I also used some data downloaded from the [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) portal but the files were too big to include in this repo.
